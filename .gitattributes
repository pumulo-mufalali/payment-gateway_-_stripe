# Recommendation for Implementation Flow

# Start with:
# Doctor Call Logs — you’ll practice model creation and form handling.

# Then add:
# Self-Care Dashboard — reuse Django authentication and add role-based logic.

# Next:
#  Automated Billing System — add real-world logic and formatting (maybe PDF).

# Then go for:
# SMS Alerts — integrate an API and make your app feel real-world ready.

# Optional fun:
# SIM/Device Registry — cool IoT-inspired idea, good for your portfolio.

# Advanced step:
# Celery tasks — for sending SMS/emails in the background.
